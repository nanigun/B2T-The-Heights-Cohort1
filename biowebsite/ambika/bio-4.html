	    <h2>I'm a New York Yankees fan</h2>
	    <p>I'm not into too many sports. I enjoy swimming and cycling. But I do love to watch the Yankees play and who doesn't love Aaron Judge. This young man is bringing a lot of interest to the game from his powerful hits. Let's hope he will be a Yankee till he retires. </p><br>

	  <h2>Picnics on Govenor's Island</h2>
	  <p>If you've never been to Governor's Island, plan a trip. For cheapskates like me, plan your picnic on a weekend so the ferry ride over is free. On weekdays, there is a fee.  With over 170 acres, there is plenty to explore.  It's my idea of a great summer spot. My husband and I bring our bikes over and a picnic basket and we're good for at least half the day. </p><br>
